<h3>Welcome to the world of basket weaving</h3>
<p>Basket weavers all around the world, we're glad to have you here! This website will help you out getting started
in your journey to the beautiful and detailed baskets you want to make. You will also learn about the history of the delicate art
that is basket weaving.</p>
<br>
<h3>Basket weaving</h3>
<p>Basket weaving (also basketry or basket making) is the process of weaving or 
sewing pliable materials into three-dimensional artifacts, such as baskets, mats, mesh bags or even furniture. 
Craftspeople and artists specialized in making baskets may be known as basket makers and basket weavers.
Basketry is made from a variety of fibrous or pliable materials—anything that will bend and form a shape. 
Examples include pine, straw, willow, oak, wisteria, forsythia, vines, stems, animal hair, hide, grasses, thread, and fine wooden splints.
There are many applications for basketry, from simple mats to hot air balloon gondolas. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-style:italic">The long, long history of basket weaving</h3>
<p>While basket weaving is one of the widest spread crafts in the history of any human civilization, it is hard to say just how old the craft is, 
because natural materials like wood, grass, and animal remains decay naturally and constantly. 
So without proper preservation, much of the history of basket making has been lost and is simply speculated upon. 
The earliest reliable evidence for basketry technology in the Middle East comes from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic phases of Tell Sabi Abyad II and Çatalhöyük.
Although no actual basketry remains were recovered, impressions on floor surfaces and on fragments of bitumen suggest that basketry objects were used for storage and architectural purposes. 
The extremely well-preserved Early Neolithic ritual cave site of Nahal Hemar yielded thousands of intact perishable artefacts, including basketry containers, fabrics, and various types of cordage.
Additional Neolithic basketry impressions have been uncovered at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), Netiv HaGdud, Beidha, Shir, Tell Sabi Abyad III, Domuztepe, Umm Dabaghiyah, Tell Maghzaliyah, Tepe Sarab, Jarmo, and Ali Kosh.
The oldest known baskets have been carbon dated to between 10,000 and 12,000 years old, earlier than any established dates for archaeological finds of pottery,
and were discovered in Faiyum in upper Egypt. Other baskets have been discovered in the Middle East that are up to 7,000 years old. However, baskets seldom survive, as they are made from perishable materials.
The most common evidence of a knowledge of basketry is an imprint of the weave on fragments of clay pots, 
formed by packing clay on the walls of the basket and firing. For more information on the fascinating history of basket weaving, please visit: <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.britannica.com/art/basketry/Origins-and-centres-of-development">Britannica</a>

<h1 style="text-align:center">So how do I make these things?</h1>
<h3>Types of baskets</h3>

<div>
Basketry may be classified into four types
<ul>
    <li>Coiled basketry, using grasses, rushes and pine needles</li>
    <li>Plaiting basketry, using materials that are wide and braidlike: palms, yucca or New Zealand flax</li>
    <li>Twining basketry, using materials from roots and tree bark.</li>
    <li>Wicker and Splint basketry, using reed, cane, willow, oak, and ash</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parts of a basket</h3>
<p>The parts of a basket are the base, the side walls, and the rim. A basket may also have a lid, handle, or embellishments.
Most baskets begin with a base. The base can either be woven with reed or wooden. A wooden base can come in many shapes to make a wide variety of shapes of baskets.
The "static" pieces of the work are laid down first. In a round basket, they are referred to as "spokes"; in other shapes, they are called "stakes" or "staves".
Then the "weavers" are used to fill in the sides of a basket.
A wide variety of patterns can be made by changing the size, colour, or placement of a certain style of weave.
To achieve a multi-coloured effect, aboriginal artists first dye the twine and then weave the twines together in complex patterns.
</p>
<h3>Tools needed</h3>
<p>Only a few simple tools are necessary in basket weaving.
Good strong scissors and a sharp knife are needed for cutting and pointing the osiers.
Side cutters work great for chipping off ends.
A pair of round-nosed pliers are valuable for kinking the stakes before bending them, particularly when the angle has to be sharp.
A bodkin isa pointed metal tool in a wooden handle. It is very helpful, both for making a space between woven work and for pushing a rod in position after the gap has been made.
But, if necessary, you could use a good strong knitting needle instead of a bodkin.
Other useful items while working include a measuring tape, protective waterproof cloth to work on and clothes pins work great to hold your work if you get interrupted.
If you decide to go on to more advanced basket weaving, a rapping iron for pushing down the weaving rows would make a welcome addition. There are also specially made work boards to hold your baskets at a convenient angle to work on.
</p>
<h3>The process</h3>
<span>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Randing</b>
<br>
The simplest form of weaving in making a basket is called randing, and is just under one stake, over the next, under the next and so on.
If you are working around continuously, you will have to have an odd number of stakes to make the pattern come out in the second row as the reverse of the first, as it should.
If you are working on an even number of stakes, you must use two separate weavers. After working the first round, start the second weaver in the space to the left of the starting point of the first weaver and work around. Then use the two weavers alternately to make the pattern work out correctly.
Randing is often used for large areas of weaving but is often broken up at intervals with pairing rows that can add some of the strength and security that it lacks itself.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Pairing</b>
<br>
This is a weaving method that uses two weavers together, twisting around each other.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Waling</b>
<br>
A very strong weaving method that is used at intervals to control the shape of the basket and often at the top, just under the border.
It is also almost always used at the beginning of the sides of a basket after the base is finished. Here waling sets up the stakes into their right positions and when used this way is called upsetting. Three rods are used.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Border Treatments</b>
<br>
The borders can be the most noticeable features of basket weaving. Basically a border is a method of tidying off the tops of the stakes securely when the weaving is finished and they can simply be bent down and tucked in. But more complicated borders can be very dramatic.
The dense braided ones are the most difficult to master and the most rewarding when you have.
A lacy open work pattern is very simple but, of course, not suitable for hard wear. The mat was worked on double stakes and these are cut off tat this stage to leave just 3" to form the border. Then the whole piece was soaked. The right stake of each pair is curved around and down to the right and inserted along the side of the left-hand stake of the next pair. 
All the right stakes are ached in this way and the remaining left ones trimmed to the length shown.

One last important hint: Always lean on the side of over-estimating the length of stakes you will need. In basket weaving you can always trim off the excess, but it is much more difficult to add on!
